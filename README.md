## Bookstore

> "Bookstore" is a is a webapp similar to the "Awesome Books" website I built previously. This is an React version of it that allows you to:
>
> - Display a list of books.
> - Add a book.
> - Remove a selected book.

> I started by building the core functionality, which is a calculator. At the very beginning my website will contain only the simple UI presented below, but it will be able to perform all math operations.
